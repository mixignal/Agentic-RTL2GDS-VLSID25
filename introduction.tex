\section{Introduction (Arun)}
\label{sec:introduction}
The development of Generative AI (GenAI) Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought significant advancements in artificial intelligence, allowing systems to generate human-like content across various mediums, including text, images, and code. Recent research has investigated the application of LLMs in digital system design, particularly in generating hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog from natural language descriptions. 

Simultaneously, agentic AI workflows have emerged, where autonomous AI agents perform specific tasks within defined parameters. These workflows are increasingly used in software design to automate tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing, thereby improving development speed and minimizing human error. However, while agentic AI workflows have proven effective in software code generation, applying these techniques to hardware design presents additional complexities. This is due to the diverse range of tools required to meet functional, correctness, and physical constraints in hardware systems.
