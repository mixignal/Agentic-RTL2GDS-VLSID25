We have introduced an agentic AI design framework aimed at boosting productivity in the development of complex digital ASICs. This framework is still in its early stages, but we plan to present more detailed evaluation results and release an open-source prototype of AiEDA by the conference.

In developing AiEDA, we faced several challenges. One key issue is whether to use a powerful general-purpose LLM like GPT-4o or to customize smaller models for specific tasks. The decision involves balancing customization and deployment costs against potential gains in accuracy and reduced operational expenses.

Another crucial consideration is the role of the designer. While it's possible to argue for an AI tool that enables novice designers to create digital ASICs independently, we believe AI should enhance human creativity rather than replace it. AiEDA is designed to allow designers to intervene and guide the process based on their expertise at any stage (Reinforcement Learining with Human Feedback). 

Future areas of exploration include creating an open-source library of design prompts and integrating optimization tools into the AI framework.
