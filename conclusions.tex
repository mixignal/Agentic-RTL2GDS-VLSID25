\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this paper, we have introduced AiEDA, an agentic AI design framework for digital ASIC design. AiEDA leverages advanced Generative AI techniques, including agentic workflows that integrate open-source EDA tools, prompt engineering, few-shot learning, self reflection, and retrieval-augmented generation. We have provided initial evaluation results based on the design of a KeyWord Spotter system. As this work continues to develop, we anticipate presenting more comprehensive evaluation findings by the conference.
